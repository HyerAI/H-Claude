# User Preferences

Learned preferences from sessions. $SCOUT updates after commands (triage).

## When to Add Entry

| Trigger | Example |
|---------|---------|
| **User emotional** | Frustration, excitement, strong reaction to approach |
| **User says "remember"** | "Remember I prefer X", "Don't forget to Y" |
| **Important subject** | Something HC thinks we should remember for future |
| **Explicit preference** | "I like X", "Never do Y", "Always Z" |

**NOT trivial:** Skip one-off situational choices. Capture lasting preferences.

## How to Learn

1. **Observe emotional reactions** - Strong positive/negative = preference signal
2. **Listen for "remember" language** - Direct instruction to capture
3. **Notice patterns** - Same choice made 2-3x = likely preference
4. **Ask when uncertain** - "Should I remember this preference?"

## Workflow

- Friction in validation is intentional ("friction is the feature")
- Quality over speed - never rush planning
- Use think-tank for substantial decisions, not inline
- Route 3+ file changes through commands
