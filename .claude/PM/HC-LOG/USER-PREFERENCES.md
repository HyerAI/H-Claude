# User Preferences

Learned preferences from sessions. $STATE updates after commands.

## When to Add Entry

| Trigger | Example |
|---------|---------|
| **User emotional** | Frustration, excitement, strong reaction to approach |
| **User says "remember"** | "Remember I prefer X", "Don't forget to Y" |
| **Important pattern** | Repeated behavior worth capturing |
| **Explicit preference** | "I like X", "Never do Y", "Always Z" |

**NOT trivial:** Skip one-off situational choices. Capture lasting preferences.
