# .claude/PM/SSoT/ROADMAP.yaml
# STATE document - Development story: HOW we build it, in what order
# Paired with: NORTHSTAR.md (the WHAT - user story, features, requirements)
#
# RULES:
# - Git is our versioning (commit before changes for rollback)
# - Dependencies determine phase transitions and parallelism
# - Each phase links to its think-tank execution-plan
# - Tech debt discovered during development belongs to relevant phases
#
# WORKFLOW:
# 1. /think-tank --roadmap creates/updates this file
# 2. /think-tank "Phase Name" --phase=PHASE-XXX creates phase plan
# 3. Phase plan links back here (plan_path)
# 4. /hc-execute runs the phase
# 5. Phase complete -> dependencies unlock next phases

  #   title: 'Foundation'
  #   status: planned  # planned | active | complete | blocked

  # - id: PHASE-002
  #   title: 'MVP Features'
  #   status: planned
  #   description: 'Core user-facing features'
