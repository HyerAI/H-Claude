# Prioritized work tracking with dependency validation
#
# RULES:
#   - P1 items should have blocked_by: null (ready to work)
#   - Session-triage validates dependencies at session start
#   - Move items up/down as blockers clear
#   - Include enough context for future-you
#
# STRUCTURE:
#   P1 = Critical (ready now, no blockers)
#   P2 = Important (has dependencies)
#   P3 = Nice to have
#   P4 = Someday/Maybe
