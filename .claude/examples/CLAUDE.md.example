  /red-team: Deep investigation audit
  /hc-phase-cycle: Full cycle - Execute, Audit, Fix, Validate

# Workflow
workflow:
  1_vision: Define goals in $NORTH
  2_roadmap: /think-tank --roadmap → $ROAD
  3_plan: /think-tank --phase=X → execution-plan.yaml
  4_execute: /hc-execute → Implementation
  5_review: /hc-glass → Quality check
  6_commit: Git commit → CHANGELOG update

# Session Protocol
session:
  start:
    - Read context.yaml for current focus
    - Check ROADMAP for active phase
  during:
    - Update context.yaml after significant work
    - Delegate to sub-agents to preserve context
    - Use $TEMP for drafts and scratch work
  end:
    - Update CHANGELOG
    - Commit with descriptive message

# Rules
rules:
  - SSoT First: Read NORTHSTAR before major decisions
  - No Assumptions: Ask for clarification when unclear
  - Fix Dont Workaround: Address root causes
  - Context is Precious: Delegate to preserve main context
  - Document Decisions: ADRs for architectural choices
  - Changelog is Worklog: Update after every commit
