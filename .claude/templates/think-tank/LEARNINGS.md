# Implementation Learnings: [Topic]

> Capture what you discover during implementation. These learnings may trigger a return to the council.

## How to Use This Document

After deciding on a path, use this document to track:
1. **Validating findings** - Evidence the decision was correct
2. **Challenging findings** - Evidence the decision needs revisiting
3. **Neutral findings** - Interesting but no action needed

When a challenging finding is significant, run `/think-tank [topic]` to reconvene the council.
