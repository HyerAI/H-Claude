# Decision Map: [Problem Title]

> **This is a living document.** Updated as new information emerges during implementation.

| Version | Date | Session | Change |
|---------|------|---------|--------|
| v1 | [date] | 1 | Initial decision |

---

## The Core Tension

[What's the fundamental trade-off? One sentence that captures the heart of the decision.]

---

## Your Constraints (as understood)

| Constraint | Type | Source |
|------------|------|--------|
| [constraint 1] | MUST | User stated |
| [constraint 2] | SHOULD | User stated |
| [constraint 3] | INFERRED | From context |

---

## Blind Spots Identified

The council identified these considerations you may not have fully weighted:

1. **[Blind spot 1]**: [Why it matters]
2. **[Blind spot 2]**: [Why it matters]
3. **[Blind spot 3]**: [Why it matters]

## The Options

### Path A: [The Aggressive/Ambitious Approach]

**Summary**: [One sentence describing this path]

| Aspect | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| **Upside** | [What you gain] |
| **Downside** | [What you give up] |
| **Risk** | [What could go wrong] |
| **Complexity** | [High/Medium/Low] |
| **Time to Value** | [How long until benefits] |
| **Reversibility** | [HIGH/MED/LOW] - [How hard to undo? Type 1 or Type 2 decision?] |

**Pre-Mortem**: If this fails in 6 months, it's because: [failure mode]

**When to choose**: [Under what conditions is this the right call?]

---

### Path B: [The Conservative/Safe Approach]

**Summary**: [One sentence describing this path]

| Aspect | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| **Upside** | [What you gain] |
| **Downside** | [What you give up] |
| **Risk** | [What could go wrong] |
| **Complexity** | [High/Medium/Low] |
| **Time to Value** | [How long until benefits] |
| **Reversibility** | [HIGH/MED/LOW] - [How hard to undo?] |

**Pre-Mortem**: If this fails in 6 months, it's because: [failure mode]

**When to choose**: [Under what conditions is this the right call?]

---

### Path C: [The Simple/Minimum Viable Approach]

**Summary**: [The "just enough" option - simplest way to achieve the core goal]

| Aspect | Assessment |
|--------|------------|
| **Upside** | [Lowest complexity, fastest to validate] |
| **Downside** | [What you defer or sacrifice] |
| **Risk** | [What could go wrong] |
| **Complexity** | [Should be LOW] |
| **Time to Value** | [Should be FAST] |
| **Reversibility** | [Should be HIGH] - [Easy to pivot from] |

**Pre-Mortem**: If this fails in 6 months, it's because: [failure mode]

**When to choose**: [When you need to move fast, validate assumptions, or preserve optionality]

---

## Council's Assessment

Given your stated constraints, the council believes **Path [X]** aligns best because:

1. [Reason tied directly to a stated constraint]
2. [Reason tied to your context or situation]
3. [Reason based on risk/reward analysis]

**However**, if any of these conditions change, reconsider:
- If [condition A changes] → **Path [Y]** becomes more attractive
- If [condition B changes] → **Path [Z]** may be necessary

---

## Open Questions

These are questions only YOU can answer - they depend on your values, risk tolerance, and priorities:

1. **[Question 1]**: [Why this matters for the decision]
2. **[Question 2]**: [Why this matters for the decision]
3. **[Question 3]**: [Why this matters for the decision]

---

## What We Didn't Cover

Topics that surfaced but weren't fully explored (potential for `/hc-plan` deep-dive):

- [ ] [Topic 1] - [Brief note on why it might matter]
- [ ] [Topic 2] - [Brief note on why it might matter]
- [ ] [Topic 3] - [Brief note on why it might matter]

---

## Decision Record

Once you decide, record it here:

**Decision**: [ ] Path A / [ ] Path B / [ ] Path C / [ ] Other

**Rationale**: [Why you chose this path]

**Date**: [When decided]

**Review Date**: [When to revisit this decision]
